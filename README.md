The BMI Calculator App is a simple tool that allows users to calculate their body mass index (BMI). With this app, users can quickly and easily determine if they are within a healthy weight range based on their height and weight. The app provides an interpretation of the result, indicating whether the user is underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. This app is user-friendly and easy to use, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to monitor their weight and ensure they are maintaining a healthy BMI. 

The app is connected with Firebase and would allow users to store and access their BMI calculations and related information on a secure, cloud-based platform. This would enable users to access their BMI data from any device with an internet connection, making it easy to track their BMI over time.
